Hello, my name is [Philo](https://www.google.co.uk). I am a full stack engineer with a passion for [Machine Learning](https://www.google.co.uk). 

I wrote my first line of code in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) (Beginners All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), which I deployed to a [GENIE 18](https://www.genieonline.com/files/genie-18-microcontroller.pdf) integrated circuit. I am pleased to say I have come a long way since then.

I have worked in both the private and public sector, and am currently looking for exciting Data Scientist or Software Engineering opportunities in London, UK.

Recently I have been focusing on developing my skills as a DevOps engineer.

Here are some tools I have been upskilling:
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Jenkins
- OpenShift
- AWS
