An implementation of DeepMind's DQN algorithm, which was presented in the 2013 paper: [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602v1.pdf). Both my own and DeepMind's agents achieved an average total reward of 20, when applying an [epsilon-greedy](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/epsilon-greedy-q-learning) policy with epsilon = 0.05; this is equivalent to winning 1-21, on average. Both agents would often concede the first point due to the game starting with the opponents paddle hidden from the player.
