A [motorway traffic violation detection system](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1XYr-Y0uwjLhWIUTqCxRJ_Z-nMgTUCH32) that utilises deep convolutional neural networks to identify undesirable driving behaviours in a dataset of simulated dash cam footage. This also required the implementation of an image processing pipeline that extracted the temporal component of the videos using [optical flow trajectory stacking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2199.pdf). The network achieved over 90% accuracy when labelling unseen data. The key application of this system is to reduce the amount of time spent by local police forces manually reviewing dash cam footage.
