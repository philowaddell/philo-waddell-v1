An OCR as a service platform built using microservice architecture. Each service utilises [Google Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for image processing and feature extraction. This project taught me a lot about the benefits of message brokers and how message queues can help to coordinate communications in distributed applications.
