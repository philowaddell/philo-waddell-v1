I am currently writing my frontends with NodeJS and React, and my microservice backends with Python and Flask. 

My Machine Learning framework of choice is PyTorch due to its pythonic feel and rapid growth in the last few years.

I am always open to learning new languages and frameworks and have just started a short course introducing the GO programming language.
