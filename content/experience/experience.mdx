I currently feel the most comfortable writing my frontends with NodeJS and React, and my backend microservices with Python and Flask. 

My Machine Learing framework of choice is PyTorch due to its pythonic feel and rapid growth in the last few years.

I am always open to learning new languages and frameworks and have just started a short course introducing the GO programming language.
